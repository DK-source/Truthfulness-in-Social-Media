        "claim_review": "When it comes to diabetes, the numbers are stark. One in 10 Americans have the disease, and more than one in three have pre-diabetes, according to the  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . What’s more, people are developing diabetes at younger ages and a faster rate. A recent tweet from U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who has cosponsored legislation to cap the out-of-pocket cost of insulin for Americans at $35 per month, made a stark claim of its own: \"The price of insulin has been jacked up by Big Drug Corporations,\" Baldwin, D-Wisconsin, said in the March 16, 2022,  tweet . \"35 million Americans who have diabetes need lower costs. We can cap the price of insulin at $35 with our Affordable Insulin Now Act. Let's have a Senate vote and pass it!\" The  House of Representatives  voted a few weeks later, on March 31, 2022, to approve the  Affordable Insulin Now Act , which would cap insulin prices at either $35 a month or 25% of an insurance plan's negotiated price — whichever is lower.   But the fate of the measure in the Senate remains unclear.  So what can one make of Baldwin’s tweet?  Are costs of insulin in the United States excessive? And what can be said about whether high prices are due to being \"jacked up by Big Drug Corporations\"?  Diabetes is a chronic health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy. Most people’s bodies naturally produce insulin, a hormone that helps convert sugars from food into energy the body can use or store for later.  \"When you have diabetes, your body either doesn’t make insulin or doesn’t use its insulin well, causing your blood sugar to rise,\" according to the CDC. \"High blood sugar levels can cause serious health problems over time.\" When a person has Type 1 diabetes, the body can’t make insulin, and he or she will need to take insulin every day. With Type 2 diabetes, your body doesn’t use insulin well.  \"Losing weight, eating well and exercising can help you manage the disease,\" according to the Mayo Clinic. \"If diet and exercise aren't enough to manage your blood sugar, you may also need diabetes medications or insulin therapy.\" About 30 million Americans have diabetes, and about 31% take insulin to manage the condition, according to the  Commonwealth Fund , a private U.S. foundation whose stated purpose is to \"promote a high-performing health care system that achieves better access, improved quality, and greater efficiency…\" According to the  American Diabetes Association , those with diabetes account for $1 of every $4 spent on healthcare in the United States. Let’s start with some statistics that underline how high costs are in the U.S.  According to an April 2020 report from the  American Action Forum,  a conservative think tank based in  Washington, D.C. , the average list price of insulin increased 11% annually from 2001 to 2018, with average annual per capita insulin costs now nearing $6,000.  According to an  October 2021  report from the Health Care Cost Institute, an independent nonprofit that studies health care prices, in its data sample the average monthly out-of-pocket spending on insulin in 2019 was $82. And \"among the 8.7% of individuals in the highest spending category, the median monthly out-of-pocket spending on insulin was $315.\" The  U.S. Department of Health and Human Services  says Americans pay  10 times  what people in other developed countries pay. Meanwhile, a January 2021  Forbes  article reported that net costs of insulin to pharmacy benefit managers and payers have decreased in recent years because of steep rebates, but the savings very often have not been passed through to patients.  The bottom line: Americans pay a high cost for insulin – far higher than in other countries. But in her claim, Baldwin pinned the blame on the drug companies, when there are many factors involved in pricing and many points where prices – and profits – can be increased.  When we asked Baldwin’s office for backup for the claim, it pointed us to several reports and articles on insulin costs and affordability and a 2021 Senate committee report on what is behind it. The bipartisan staff  report  from the Senate Finance Committee noted that \"(insulin) manufacturers are retaining more revenue from insulin than in the 2000s,\" and that \"the amount of revenue pharmaceutical manufacturers are retaining from insulin has risen.\" \"Insulin manufacturers compete fiercely, using rebates as bargaining chips to receive preferred formulary placement for their products and to block competition,\" the Senate report reads.  \"The companies undertake these bidding wars to maximize revenue and capture — or maintain — market share. Furthermore, in some cases the investigation found that while insulin manufacturers closely monitor their competitors’ pricing actions when determining their own list prices over time, there were multiple instances of companies increasing prices in lockstep with competitors.\" So, that supports Baldwin’s claim. But others note that’s not the full picture. Dr. Jing Luo , assistant professor of Medicine at the Center for Pharmaceutical Policy and Prescribing at the University of Pittsburgh, said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin, \"There was a time when list prices for insulin rose at a rapid clip…on the order of 30% per year. Those price increases came from the manufacturers themselves.\" Luo, whose research focuses on prescription drug use, pricing and policy, especially for medicines treating chronic diseases such as diabetes, also noted: \"In recent years we have noticed that the list price changes are not as dramatic as they had been previously. This is probably due to much higher public scrutiny.\" Luo, in a Dec. 10, 2021 WBUR radio  article  said the limited number of TextEditor manufacturers in the U.S. are part of the equation. \"When you have a setting where there (are) only a few suppliers, but the demand for the medication is quite great,\" he told WBUR, \"it results in a situation where manufacturers can raise their prices without much blowback.\" As to Baldwin’s claim, he said it is \"a simplification of the complex system we have that allows drug manufacturers to set whatever price they desire.\" Karen Van Nuys, executive director of Value of Life Sciences Innovation at the University of Southern California, said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin that big drug corporations often get the blame for rising insulin prices, but their research shows \"they are actually not the culprits in this case.\" \"The amount manufacturers have been receiving per 100mL of insulin has actually been declining steadily over the last several years,\" Van Nuys said. \"What has been increasing is the amount of money drug distribution intermediaries — pharmacies, pharmacy benefit managers, health plans and wholesalers — have been pocketing.\" Insulin is measured in International Units (units); most insulin is U-100, which means that 100 units of insulin are equal to 1 mL. Baldwin said \"the price of insulin has been jacked up by Big Drug Corporations.\" There is no question that U.S. consumers pay more than those in other countries. And there is strong evidence that drug company profits are a key factor in the higher costs. But experts note that there are other factors involved – and other steps along the way where profits are taken. And those entities also play a role in the higher costs.

And even before it was published, Germany’s parliament had  voted in early 2013 to criminalize  \"using an animal for personal sexual activities.\" In the video, Knowles said, \"One thing we predicted was that if you lift the traditional social and political restrictions on sexual activity and you redefine marriage and you redefine the whole family …you’re going to have people not just having sex with each other … you’re going to have people having sex with animals.\" We reached out to Knowles for comment but did not receive a reply. The claim about bestiality brothels appears to have come from a single person who the Daily Mail identified as a \"livestock protection officer.\" The officer didn’t provide any examples of the brothels but cited a German farmer who was concerned about his sheep which he said had been sexually abused by men sneaking into his barn. In the Daily Mail story, the livestock protection officer calls for the government to ban bestiality, something the German government had already done months before the story published. A bid to overturn the law was  shot down  by Germany's constitutional court in 2016. We did not find any credible reports of \"bestiality brothels\" spreading in Germany. The caption on an April 6 Facebook video said, \"German perverts open bestiality brothels.\" It cited a Daily Mail story that allegedly was published \"today.\" But the Daily Mail story was published in July 2013 and contained outdated information. The German government outlawed bestiality in February 2013. We found no credible reports to back the claim. We rate this post False.   ",

The Twitter post was a joke and did not seriously argue that Elon Musk should have used the money he spent on buying Twitter shares to give every American family $100,000.    Even if it was serious, the math is wrong. $3 billion divided by 122 million households would be $24.59 for each family with nothing leftover to cancel student debt.     Americans owe an estimated $1.74 trillion in student loans.",
        "claim_review": "A viral social media post is claiming the $3 billion Elon Musk spent buying a 9% stake in Twitter should’ve been directly given to the American people instead. The  April 5 tweet  was made following the announcement that the Tesla CEO would  join Twitter’s board of directors  after purchasing 73.5 million shares of the company’s stock. \"With the money Elon Musk spent to buy Twitter shares, he could have given every American family $100,000 and still had enough left over to cancel all student debt,\" tweeted Hunter Walk, the co-founder of a venture capital firm. If Walk’s tweet sparked a sense of familiarity, it’s because it echoed a similar claim involving Michael Bloomberg. During the 2020 presidential election, a claim was made that Bloomberg’s campaign spent $500 million on advertising. A social media user at the time said the money could’ve been used to give all 327 million people in the United States $1 million each. PolitiFact found the Bloomberg critic’s  math was flawed . If $500 million was actually divided among 327 million people, it would amount to about $1.53 per person. Walk’s tweet also includes faulty math. Although he doesn’t say what is considered a family, there are at least 122 million households in America with about 2.6 people per household, according to the  U.S. Census Bureau . Dividing $3 billion by 122 million households would result in each unit getting $24.59, with nothing leftover to tackle student debt. Even if Musk’s $3 billion was dedicated toward paying off college loans, it wouldn’t cover a quarter-percent of what’s owed.  It's estimated that Americans owe around  $1.74 trillion in student loans .  Walk later admitted he wasn’t being serious with his claim and said in  one reply  that it was a \"troll twete.\" In a  follow-up tweet  on April 6, he joked about his post triggering a fact-check by Twitter’s Birdwatch feature. \"What did I learn? People on left don't do math and people on right are really willing to defend their rich icons,\" Walk said. \"And crypto folks are generally vocal but sometimes funny.\" A user on Twitter said the $3 billion Elon Musk used to buy shares of Twitter could’ve been redistributed to give $100,000 to each American family and eliminate student debt. But $3 billion divided among all the families in America would be nowhere close to $100,000. It also wouldn’t even come close to covering the $1.74 trillion that Americans owe in student loans.  We rate this Twitter post as Pants on Fire!",

But there’s just one problem: the  Vancouver Times  describes itself as a satirical website. That means the article is not, in fact, true.  The  article  appears under the website’s Satire section. It’s easy to see how this type of article could trick people — in the Instagram post, there are no markings indicating that the article is fake. The name of the website — Vancouver Times — may also sound to some people like a legitimate publication. But satire is something  we’ve seen  before used as a tool to mislead people.  Plenty of  fact - checks  have  debunked  the claim about Chapek.  Chapek has apologized for not taking a more forceful stand against the Florida bill..

        "claim_review": "Following other false claims that Dr. Anthony Fauci  disappeared from public view  or  was indicted , an Instagram post wrongly says the nation’s infectious disease chief has been arrested. \"Special Forces arrest Deep State Dr. Anthony Fauci\" on Saturday says the April 11  post , which is a screenshot of a  story  from Real Raw News, a website that regularly  publishes false stories  with sensational headlines. The Instagram post included the hashtags #crimesagainsthumanity #traitor and #treason. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our  partnership with Facebook .) The claim is false, said Renate Myles, acting director of the Office of Communications for the National Institutes of Health. On April 10, the day after the story claims Fauci was arrested, Fauci  appeared live  on the ABC News show \"This Week.\" The baseless story about Fauci includes fabricated details such as, \"When traveling to and from events, Fauci used decoy vehicles to reduce risk of being captured.

(Read more about our  partnership with Facebook .) Let’s start with money laundering.  Ukraine is \"not even close\" to being the money laundering capital of the world, said Moyara Ruehsen, who oversees the financial crime management program at Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. Ruehsen pointed us to two lists used to gauge money laundering risk around the world.  First is the  Basel AML Index , with AML standing for anti-money laundering.  According to the global ranking in 2021, Haiti was No. 1, followed by the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Myanmar, Mozambique and the Cayman Islands. Ukraine was 55th, landing between Russia (44th) and the United States (83rd).   Next, Ruehsen directed us to the jurisdictions under increased monitoring by the Financial Action Task Force, a global  watchdog  that sets international standards aimed at preventing money laundering. The task force keeps a  \"grey list\"  — countries under increased monitoring as they address deficiencies in their anti-money laundering — and a \" black list ,\" countries Ruehsen said people shouldn’t do business with at all.  Ukraine is on neither list. (Iran and North Korea are on the black list.) The European Commission also  identifies  high-risk countries that have \"strategic deficiencies in their regime on anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism.\" Afghanistan, Cambodia, and Pakistan are on the list, but Ukraine is not among them.  Ukraine was on FATF’s \"grey list\" about 20 years ago, Ruehsen said, and up until 2014, when the country’s former president, Viktor Yanukovych, was overthrown, Ukrainian leadership was widely considered to be corrupt. \"I don’t doubt it that a lot of that corrupt behavior trickled down to lower levels of government,\" Ruehsen said. Meanwhile, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the country’s current president, campaigned on addressing corruption. The claim that Ukraine is the money laundering capital of the world, she said, \"sounds like Russian propaganda.\"  As for sex trafficking, we’ve previously  debunked  a claim that Russian President Vladimir Putin vowed to \"‘crush’ child sex traffickers in Ukraine.\" According to the State Department’s latest Trafficking in Persons report, Russia has a more serious problem with child sex trafficking than Ukraine. Both countries struggle with the issue, the report said,  but Ukraine took action  to address it between 2020 and 2021,  while Russia failed  to make \"significant efforts\" to eliminate the problem. While Ukraine convicted traffickers, increased financial assistance to victims, and launched awareness campaigns, Russia \"convicted only one trafficker,\" failed to \"initiate any new prosecutions of suspected traffickers,\" and \"offered no funding or programs to provide services for trafficking victims.\" Russia, not Ukraine, is among 11 governments the report says have \"a documented ‘policy or pattern’ of human trafficking, trafficking in government-funded programs, forced labor in government-affiliated medical services or other sectors, sexual slavery in government camps, or employment or recruitment of child soldiers.  The report also ranks countries based on the extent of government efforts to meet minimum standards for the elimination of human trafficking. Tier 1, the United States’ ranking, is the highest, but it doesn’t mean the country has no human trafficking problems. Rather, it means the country fully meets minimum standards to eliminate trafficking. Tier 2 — Ukraine’s tier — means a country’s government doesn’t fully meet the minimum standards but is making significant efforts to bring itself into compliance. Tier 3 includes countries such as Afghanistan and Russia that don’t meet the minimum standards and aren’t trying to.  We rate this post False.",

The European Commission also  identifies  high-risk countries that have \"strategic deficiencies in their regime on anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism.\" Afghanistan, Cambodia, and Pakistan are on the list, but Ukraine is not among them.  Ukraine was on FATF’s \"grey list\" about 20 years ago, Ruehsen said, and up until 2014, when the country’s former president, Viktor Yanukovych, was overthrown, Ukrainian leadership was widely considered to be corrupt. \"I don’t doubt it that a lot of that corrupt behavior trickled down to lower levels of government,\" Ruehsen said. Meanwhile, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the country’s current president, campaigned on addressing corruption. The claim that Ukraine is the money laundering capital of the world, she said, \"sounds like Russian propaganda.\"  As for sex trafficking, we’ve previously  debunked  a claim that Russian President Vladimir Putin vowed to \"‘crush’ child sex traffickers in Ukraine.\" According to the State Department’s latest Trafficking in Persons report, Russia has a more serious problem with child sex trafficking than Ukraine. Both countries struggle with the issue, the report said,  but Ukraine took action  to address it between 2020 and 2021,  while Russia failed  to make \"significant efforts\" to eliminate the problem. While Ukraine convicted traffickers, increased financial assistance to victims, and launched awareness campaigns, Russia \"convicted only one trafficker,\" failed to \"initiate any new prosecutions of suspected traffickers,\" and \"offered no funding or programs to provide services for trafficking victims.\" Russia, not Ukraine, is among 11 governments the report says have \"a documented ‘policy or pattern’ of human trafficking, trafficking in government-funded programs, forced labor in government-affiliated medical services or other sectors, sexual slavery in government camps, or employment or recruitment of child soldiers.  The report also ranks countries based on the extent of government efforts to meet minimum standards for the elimination of human trafficking. Tier 1, the United States’ ranking, is the highest, but it doesn’t mean the country has no human trafficking problems. Rather, it means the country fully meets minimum standards to eliminate trafficking. Tier 2 — Ukraine’s tier — means a country’s government doesn’t fully meet the minimum standards but is making significant efforts to bring itself into compliance. Tier 3 includes countries such as Afghanistan and Russia that don’t meet the minimum standards and aren’t trying to.  We rate this post False.",

        "claim_review_summary": "No, Biden’s trip to Poland wasn’t staged.   Multiple photographs, videos and news articles show that President Joe Biden visited the Presidential Palace in Warsaw on March 26, where he met with President Andrzej Duda.     While there appears to be something covering the exterior of the building at the entrance, possibly due to renovations, wider shots show the entirety of the building and courtyard.     Biden was also photographed and recorded during a visit with U.S. troops on March 25 and giving a speech on March 26.",
        "claim_review": "The appearance of the exterior of the Polish Presidential Palace in Warsaw left one social media user claiming that President Joe Biden’s visit there was staged. \"Y’all waking up yet? You’re watching a movie,\" read the caption for a  video  posted on Facebook on April 6. You trust everything that’s going on over there? Why would they have to fake a building? Where are they really?\" The video plays a clip of Biden’s arrival and we hear a different person describe a \"wrinkly wall and a wrinkly window\" before the narrator isolates an image he claims shows a \"fake building.\" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our  partnership with Facebook .) After stopping to visit U.S. troops a day earlier, Biden was greeted at the presidential palace in Warsaw on March 26 by Polish President Andrzej Duda. In one  image  from the president of Poland’s official website (see the seventh image in the gallery at the bottom), you can see what looks like scaffolding on the left side of the building and the wall almost looks like a painting. We reached out to Jakub Szymczuk, Duda’s official photographer who took the photo, for an explanation, but have not received a response.  We also reached out to the White House, the Secret Service, Duda’s office and other photographers at the scene to explain the building’s appearance, but didn’t hear back. The exterior of the building looked different in this  Oct. 26, 2021 , photo when Jordan’s King Abdullah II visited the palace, and on  March 19, 2017 , when Germany's President Frank-Walter Steinmeier visited. It’s not clear if the palace was being renovated when Biden visited, but articles translated from Polish  from August  discuss planned  renovations  on all  presidential properties , including the presidential palace. But it’s clear the building itself is real, as was Biden’s visit. Wider  photographs  and  videos  from the  scene  show the full courtyard of the palace and Biden’s arrival. Biden was photographed  visiting  with U.S. troops on March 25 and  giving a speech  outside the Royal Castle in Warsaw on March 26 after his visit with Duda. The trip was widely covered by major news outlets, such as  Fox News ,  the Wall Street Journal , the  New York Times  and many others, with no suggestion the event was staged. Szymczuk, Duda’s photographer,  posted a selfie  with Biden inside the palace on Facebook the same day. The palace was built in the 1640s and has served many purposes over the centuries, according to the  official website  of the Polish president. The main body of the palace was mostly destroyed by a fire in 1852 and the building has been renovated multiple times over the years. After one such renovation in 1994, it became the \"official seat of the President of the Republic of Poland,\" the site said.  PolitiFact has debunked multiple false allegations since Biden took office that he and the White House have staged various events, including that Biden  created a fake set  to receive a COVID-19 vaccine booster, that he  faked an interview  in front of a green screen, and that an anti-lynching bill signing ceremony  didn’t really happen . We can add this claim to the list. A Facebook post alleged that Biden’s trip to Poland was staged because the Presidential Palace in Warsaw looks fake. It does appear that there may be something covering the exterior of the building, but wider shots and video show the whole courtyard of the palace. Polish websites show articles from August detailing planned renovations at presidential properties. In addition, there was widespread news coverage, some of it live, of Biden’s stop in Poland, which included a visit with U.S. troops and a speech outside the Royal Castle. To believe Biden’s trip to Europe was staged would mean believing a widespread conspiracy involving another country and the media. We rate this claim False.",

At one point, white arrows appear, pointing to their necks as Mendez can be heard discussing a \"new advanced disguise system\" and face masks.  \"Master of disguise,\" one account sharing the video said. \"Chief of Disguise CIA explains. We are watching a movie  . When the truth comes out, people will be shocked. Bidan ain’t Biden. How can we trust anything we see on the news? There’s more actors than you can possibly imagine.\" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our  partnership with Facebook .) This claim is unfounded and there is no evidence to support it. Blasey Ford and Kavanaugh have been photographed and appeared publicly before and after Blasey Ford’s allegations about Kavanaugh’s actions were made public.  High school  yearbook   photos  of them are recognizable as the people who appeared on national television during the confirmation hearing that day.  Blasey Ford is a  professor  at Palo Alto University, where she works at the Pacific Graduate School of Psychology. And Kavanaugh, of course, sits on the highest court in the country and has considered legal cases since he was confirmed in 2018.  We rate this post Pants on Fire!",

        "claim_review": "A Virginia politician resigned days after news surfaced that he wrote a racist Facebook post about two Black military leaders, including U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. But a tweet from liberal Facebook page Occupied Democrats criticized the wrong person as being the post’s author. \"BREAKING: Virginia Republican Party Chairman makes a shockingly racist Facebook post calling President Biden’s Black Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin a ‘dirty, stinking n-----,’ calls for a ‘civil war.’ He’s refusing to step down over his post,\" Occupy Democrats  tweeted .  A Twitter user saw the tweet and  asked us  if it was true. The person who made the statements was a local official, not someone in a statewide leadership position. Occupy Democrats later sent a corrected tweet. The real author of the post was David Dietrich, who is not the chairman of Virginia’s GOP. Rather, he’s the chairman of the Hampton Electoral Board in Virginia. Dietrich led the three-member board, which oversees elections in Hampton’s city of over 137,000 residents. Hampton is located in the southeastern part of Virginia, near the city of Norfolk.  Dietrich  made the post  in February 2021. Under the headline \"Military Purge,\" Deitrich lashed out at Austin’s appointment as defense secretary, saying that Austin was \"standing down the military to ferret out ‘white nationalists’\" in order to \"remove conservative, freedom-loving Americans from the roles.\" He also bashed retired Army Lt. Gen. Russel L. Honoré, whom House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  tasked  with leading a review of security at the Capitol following the Jan. 6 insurrection. \"To listen to this guy, you would think he was a Black Nationalist,\" Dietrich wrote.  Dietrich went on to call the two military leaders \"nothing more than dirty, stinking n------\" and said, \"Perhaps the best way to pull us back from the brink is a good public lynching.\"  A local Virginia TV station, WAVY-TV, was the  first  to break the story on April 8, 2022. It reported that Dietrich’s comments came to light after the Republican Party of Hampton released them in a statement. The party  said  it was made aware of Dietrich’s post the week before. It condemned Dietrich’s comments as \"abhorrent and unacceptable\" and called for him to resign, as did Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican.  \"The abhorrent words of a Hampton Roads official are beyond unacceptable and have no place in Virginia,\" Youngkin wrote. \"It’s time to resign.\" After initially refusing to do so, Dietrich  resigned  on April 9. The official who was wrongly identified as the speaker of the racist claims is Virginia GOP chairman Richard Anderson. The Virginia GOP Twitter account replied to Occupy Democrats  on April 8 , writing that the group was \"spreading misinformation.\" \"We have demanded his resignation and asked the circuit court to remove him,\" the Virginia GOP tweet said. Occupy Democrats  issued a correction  of its tweet on April 11. However, by then several Facebook users had copied and shared the uncorrected text of the original claim.  A tweet from Occupy Democrats pointed to the chairman of Virginia’s Republican Party as the one who authored a racist post about Austin and Honoré. The racist post was real, but it was made by the chairman of the Electoral Board in Hampton, Virginia, not the state’s GOP.  We rate this claim False. UPDATE, April 12 at 5p.m.:  We updated this fact-check shortly after publication with a tweet addressing the Occupy Democrats claim from the Virginia GOP.",

        "claim_review": "As she runs for the Republican nomination for governor, Rebecca Kleefisch is – understandably – touting the accomplishments during the Gov. Scott Walker administration. Kleefisch, of course, was lieutenant governor, not governor. So, her claim in a  recent TV ad  caught our attention. In the ad, released March 28, 2022, Kleefisch is seen speaking to a crowd declaring: \"As your lieutenant governor, I beat the liberal mob, I cut your taxes, and I protected your freedoms.\"  Is that accurate?  Can the lieutenant governor – who does not introduce or write legislation, and does not sign or veto bills – cut taxes?  Let’s take a closer look at the claim, and what role – if any – Kleefisch played.  First, let’s take a look at taxes during the time Kleefisch served under Walker, who served from 2011 to 2019. During that time PolitiFact Wisconsin looked at many tax-cut claims. Indeed, there were more than $8 billion in tax cuts between 2011 and the time of  a 2018 fact check . The nonpartisan state Legislative Fiscal Bureau provided the estimate of about $8.47 billion in tax savings, between income and franchise tax reductions, property tax reductions, and other cuts. So, what was Kleefisch’s role? When asked for backup, Kleefisch’s campaign team said she attended most budget briefings during the Walker administration, and during discussions around the 2017-19 budget traveled the state with the budget director to tout the plan.  Her campaign also shared  an April 1, 2014 article from the Wisconsin State Journal , headlined \"Once ‘radioactive,’ Rebecca Kleefisch has become a ‘trusted ally and lieutenant’,\" in which Walker said that Kleefisch was quick to get involved after her election.   \"She was directly involved in the budget planning process during the transition period and then in each of the budget periods once we took office,\" it quotes Walker as saying. The article also noted how Kleefisch led tax roundtables ahead of the 2015-’17 budget with former Revenue Secretary Richard Chandler, and how the feedback collected at those roundtables was directly tied into plans.  Walker also testified to Kleefisch’s involvement in conversations regarding the budget:  \"Rebecca Kleefisch immediately joined me and other key members of our transition team for the daily budget briefings,\" he said in a statement. Chandler, who served as the Department of Revenue Secretary during the Walker administration, said Kleefisch organized and sat through roundtables about taxes, eventually pulling together a report that was used during budget sessions.  \"She brought back a lot of input from all of those discussions,\" Chandler said.   All of that may be true, but experts told us Kleefisch overstates her role in the ad. John Witte, a professor of political science and public affairs at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, noted the formal budget is submitted every two years by the governor in Wisconsin, not the lieutenant governor.  \"It is possible, and even likely, that she had some input before the submission,\" Witte said in an email. \"How much is probably unknowable without detailed access to documents, memos, etc.\"  To be sure, according to the  state constitution  and  state laws , lieutenant governors in Wisconsin have no role in approving tax cuts or any other types of legislation. What’s more, Walker shaped many of the tax cuts, but Republicans who control the Legislature also put their stamp on them.  So while Kleefisch may have been involved in the talks surrounding budgets and tax cuts during the Walker administration, she had no direct role in cutting those taxes. In a TV ad, Kleefisch declared: \"As your lieutenant governor, I beat the liberal mob, I cut your taxes. Taxes were surely cut during the Walker administration – to the tune of more than  $8 billion during their eight years in office.  Kleefisch participated in budget discussions and held listening sessions across the state. And she may have advocated for those tax cuts, but the lieutenant governor simply isn’t responsible for voting on or signing tax cuts or other types of legislation into law.  Our definition of Mostly False is a statement that \"contains an element of the truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.\" That fits here.  ",

Chandler, who served as the Department of Revenue Secretary during the Walker administration, said Kleefisch organized and sat through roundtables about taxes, eventually pulling together a report that was used during budget sessions.  \"She brought back a lot of input from all of those discussions,\" Chandler said.   All of that may be true, but experts told us Kleefisch overstates her role in the ad. John Witte, a professor of political science and public affairs at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, noted the formal budget is submitted every two years by the governor in Wisconsin, not the lieutenant governor.  \"It is possible, and even likely, that she had some input before the submission,\" Witte said in an email. \"How much is probably unknowable without detailed access to documents, memos, etc.\"  To be sure, according to the  state constitution  and  state laws , lieutenant governors in Wisconsin have no role in approving tax cuts or any other types of legislation. What’s more, Walker shaped many of the tax cuts, but Republicans who control the Legislature also put their stamp on them.  So while Kleefisch may have been involved in the talks surrounding budgets and tax cuts during the Walker administration, she had no direct role in cutting those taxes. In a TV ad, Kleefisch declared: \"As your lieutenant governor, I beat the liberal mob, I cut your taxes. Taxes were surely cut during the Walker administration – to the tune of more than  $8 billion during their eight years in office.  Kleefisch participated in budget discussions and held listening sessions across the state. And she may have advocated for those tax cuts, but the lieutenant governor simply isn’t responsible for voting on or signing tax cuts or other types of legislation into law.  Our definition of Mostly False is a statement that \"contains an element of the truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.\" That fits here.  ",

Kleefisch did travel the state talking with residents and businesses about tax reforms during the budget process     She also routinely participated in budget meetings with former Gov. Walker and members of his cabinet     But that doesn’t change the fact that the lieutenant governor just isn’t responsible for introducing, voting on or signing measures like tax cuts into law.",
        "claim_review": "As she runs for the Republican nomination for governor, Rebecca Kleefisch is – understandably – touting the accomplishments during the Gov. Scott Walker administration. Kleefisch, of course, was lieutenant governor, not governor. So, her claim in a  recent TV ad  caught our attention. In the ad, released March 28, 2022, Kleefisch is seen speaking to a crowd declaring: \"As your lieutenant governor, I beat the liberal mob, I cut your taxes, and I protected your freedoms.\"  Is that accurate?  Can the lieutenant governor – who does not introduce or write legislation, and does not sign or veto bills – cut taxes?  Let’s take a closer look at the claim, and what role – if any – Kleefisch played.  First, let’s take a look at taxes during the time Kleefisch served under Walker, who served from 2011 to 2019. During that time PolitiFact Wisconsin looked at many tax-cut claims. Indeed, there were more than $8 billion in tax cuts between 2011 and the time of  a 2018 fact check . The nonpartisan state Legislative Fiscal Bureau provided the estimate of about $8.47 billion in tax savings, between income and franchise tax reductions, property tax reductions, and other cuts. So, what was Kleefisch’s role? When asked for backup, Kleefisch’s campaign team said she attended most budget briefings during the Walker administration, and during discussions around the 2017-19 budget traveled the state with the budget director to tout the plan.  Her campaign also shared  an April 1, 2014 article from the Wisconsin State Journal , headlined \"Once ‘radioactive,’ Rebecca Kleefisch has become a ‘trusted ally and lieutenant’,\" in which Walker said that Kleefisch was quick to get involved after her election.   \"She was directly involved in the budget planning process during the transition period and then in each of the budget periods once we took office,\" it quotes Walker as saying.
